# FlashCard
### I wrote this app based on a psychological theory for memorizing vocabularies

## Introduction

>When I was 18 years old, a psychologist told me how to save vocabularies for university entrance exam.

>He said when you see a new vocabulary, write it in a flash card and review it tomorrow.

>If you answered correctly, review it two days later, else consider it new vocabulary.

>If you answered correctly after two days, review it four days later, else consider it new vocabulary.

>Continue this process.

I used this guide and got good answer, but I'm not in mode of paper flashcards so I write this app.

I may write its android app later.

## How to Run

Just extract ***dist.rar*** and run ***main.exe***

## How to use it

After running the app, you can add, remove, or take a quiz if your reviewing time has come.



## Finally
**I hope this helps you in memorizing vocabulary**
